Corrections:

1) Install matlab in a folder without having space 
   in the path (eg. C:\Matlab20142\)

2) In the template "ert_linux.tmf" set HOST = ANY to 
   be able to cross compile from windows

3) In the template "ert_linux.tmf" set GCC_TEST_OUT = > nul 
   (instead of GCC_TEST_OUT = > /dev/null)

4) In the code generation pane, next to the make command
   write CC=arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc

5) For UDP blocks code generations, in "ert_linux.tmf" set
   ADDITIONAL_LDFLAGS = -ldl
